Introducing Chroma Flow Studio.
<br>

The swiss-army knife to ChromaDB - with every management task at your fingertips! 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Intended for Windows OS
But could be adapted for linux by creating the equivilant .sh scripts instead of .bat files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>

Whether you're a total beginner or veteran,<Br>
The aim is to lower the barrier to entry, and make learning, using, or developing with ChromaDB fast, easy, <br>
and,<br>
<br>
dare I say, even a little fun?<Br>
<br>
<br>

A **Pure Python** ChromaDB Client,<br>
Using Flask HTML and javascript for the Front End UI.<br>
Persists ChromaDB Data to disk by default<br>


With over 15,000 Lines of code, this is one mighty App! <bR>
Here's a peek at what Chroma Flow Studio can do for you: <br>

- **Dashboard Overview:**
  Get a clear, concise snapshot of your entire ChromaDB setup right from the dashboard.
  
- **Collections Page:**
  View all your collections, and perform essential actions like adding, copying, cloning, or deleting them – all with just a click. Plus, we've got handy templates for metadata and default settings to help you hit the ground running without the fuss.
  
- **Add Documents with Ease:**
  No need to manually assign IDs! Documents can be added with auto-generated IDs, plus customizable metadata templates to save you time.
  
- **Bulk Document Imports and Updates:**
  Need to add or update a lot of documents at once? No problem. Import documents in bulk with a simple JSON file, or update them in bulk too.
  
- **Document Management:**
  Whether you need to update a single document, copy one, or delete them (individually, in groups, or all at once), Chroma Flow Studio makes it easy to manage your documents at lightning speed.
  
- **Document Overview:**
  See all the important details of your documents – from IDs and contents to metadata and embeddings. Want to filter, edit, delete, or review your documents? It's all at your fingertips
  
- **Document Export:**
  You can easily export documents to JSON, select the content and records you want, and even choose where to send them. Simple as that!
  
- **Similarity Searches:**
  Run similarity searches - including the ability to filter for both documents and metadata. Precision searching has never been easier.
  
- **Quick Embedding Model Swaps:**
  Test out different embedding models and compare their performance in mere seconds – perfect for finding the best one for your use case.
  
- **Cloning and Re-Embedding:**
  Clone your data and re-embed it with a different model – a feature that ChromaDB's Python library doesn't even support natively, but I've added it here just for you!
  
- **Bulk Deletions**
  Another feature that ChromaDB's Python library doesn't support natively - Clear all documents from a Collection instantly in just a click!
  
- **Flask Server Configuration:**
  Easily configure the Flask server endpoint to suit your needs, with the flexibility to point to any ChromaDB SQLite file. Switching between them is as easy as flipping a switch.
  
- **Proxy Support:**
  Using a proxy? No problem! Chroma Flow Studio supports that too.
  
- **Built-in Tools:**
  UUIDs, Hashes, Timestamps, Embedding generation – all available on the fly. Need to generate synthetic data for testing? It's all ready to go. Plus, there's a handy token counter built right in.

- **Visualize your Data!:**
  Get a graphical representation of your collections by Visualizing your data points! (NOTE: requires chrome/firefox/edge to render, if you have issues, try other browsers)
  
- **Python Code Snippets:**
  At the bottom of the Collections / Documents / Update / Search Pages are Python code snippets showing how to perform those actions programatically. Just copy, paste, run, and done!
  
- **And More!**

Chroma Flow Studio brings everything you need in one place, wrapped in a simple UI,
with a range of tools built-in, detailed overviews, and embedded knowledge, everything is just a click away.

**Getting Started with Chroma Flow Studio**<br>

**Creating Collections:** <Br>
On the collections page, creating a collection is simple and easy. <Br>
Collection names are autogenerated for convenience, as are the configuration fields and metadata—but you can still configure all of them. <Br>
There are options to copy a collection's details to a new empty collection, or clone an existing collection, including all its data. <Br>
Deleting collections one at a time or in bulk is just a single button click. <Br>

<br>
<br>

**Adding Documents:** <Br>
You can add documents one at a time, including setting metadata. <br>
There are quick buttons to set metadata templates with many useful attributes you could apply for a document. <br>
Or, import documents in bulk. <br>
You can also update documents individually or in bulk. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

**Viewing Documents:** <Br>
On the view documents page:<br>
- select your collection,
- apply filters,
- choose how many results to return,
and quickly see your document IDs, contents, metadata, and embeddings.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

**Searching:** <br>
Similarity search is simple and easy to use. <bR>
Plus, there are filter options for specific document contents and/or metadata fields to create dynamic and specific queries. <br>
Quick buttons are provided to create your desired filters with speed, with full customization. <br>

<Br>
<br>

**Visualize Data:** <br>
The Visualize page gives you a graphical representation of your collections so you can see how similar groups of documents are to one another. <br>
It's also helpful to see how different embedding models generate different visuals on the same data, as a quicker way to see if they’re more accurate for your use case. <bR>

<br>
<br>

**Exporting Data:** <br>
The export page lets you pick documents, metadata, embeddings, or all of them to export into a JSON file. <br>
You can preview what data would be exported before committing to it <br>
And configure the filename and output directory. <br>
Simple. <br>
